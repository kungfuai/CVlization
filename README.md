This repo serves 3 purposes:

1. Make it easier to customize and operate computer vision model training for client projects, than if we start from standard tooling like tensorflow, torch, torchvision.
2. Provide common quality check and diagnostic tools for the model training workflow.
3. Make it easier to vet new computer vision research, by providing benchmark dataset connectors, and by having an abstraction that can accomodate training scripts in many research repos.
