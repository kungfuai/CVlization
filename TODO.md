## Backlog
- [readability] `raw_shape` for image columns: be more explicit whether it is before or after transform. In `type_checks.py`, make sure the expected shape is correct.
- [readability] Consider separating `ModelSpec` into `ModelSignature` (inputs, outputs) from `ModelArchitectureSpec` (model internals).
- [bug] `bin/train.sh -m noop -d vocsegmentation_torchvision` does not work.
- Rename cvlization.keras to tensorflow.
- [minor] `torchvision.datasets.VOCDetection` extracts the data file repeatedly. This step should be checkpointed.
- [test] Add test on data loader where individual training examples are missing or corrupted (simulating a flaky remote data store).
- (need discussion) Possibly rewrite model components (e.g. KerasImageEncoder) as framework specific models (keras.Layer, nn.Module).
    - Reason 1: keras.Model and nn.Module is well understood. We want users to easily drop in their implementations of the model components to replace the default ones in our library.
    - Reason 2: Saving of keras.Layer/Model and nn.Module is also well understood. Additional info about the custom model (e.g. which layers to extract features from) can be saved in the custom model. Our library does not need to worry about that.
    - For keras.Layer, using keras registery can be handy. When loading the trained model using our library, the user does need to install our lib so that the custom objects are available.
- Object detection models:
    - ImageEncoder to output a list of tensors at different resolutions.
    - ImageEncoder to inlude feature pyramid layers.
    - Anchor based vs. anchor free models.
    - Encoder of bounding boxes from a sparse list to a dense tensor.
- Make sure the trainer checks that the model can be saved and loaded.
- TODO: compare several tf gradient accumulation recipes, their impact on multigpu training.
- TODO: keras model does not work as well for cifar10?
- TODO: move experiment tracker to experiment level
- TODO: keras training: not tracked into wandb
- TODO: prediction_task: sometimes different prediction tasks are carried out sequentially
- TODO: `import cvlization` should not require tf or torch.
