# Archived Examples

This directory contains examples that have been archived due to being incomplete, unmaintained, or superseded by better alternatives.

## Archived Examples

### video_generation/

- **kandinsky** - Archived due to lack of documentation and incomplete implementation. No README, minimal Dockerfile-only setup.

### image_generation/

- **mdt** (Masked Diffusion Transformer) - Archived despite being SOTA for image synthesis (FID 1.58 on ImageNet). Reason: Minimal documentation (22-line README) and build dependency issues (scikit-video).

## Notes

These examples are preserved for reference but are not actively maintained. For current, well-documented examples, see the main `examples/` directory.
