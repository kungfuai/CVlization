    Stream pretraining text from parquet files, tokenize, yield training batches.

    This implementation became a bit more complex because we wish to support approximate resume training.
    Instead of turning this into a Class, we opt to return the state_dict with every batch,
    and then the caller can pass in a state_dict to resume training from a desired point.
    Note that this resumption is atm only *approximate* for simplicity.
    We won't repeat the same documents but we might skip a few.
    The state_dict that is returned can be later passed into this function via `resume_state_dict` to approximately resume.

    Perfect state resumption is possible but would be a lot more bloated, probably not worth it atm.
