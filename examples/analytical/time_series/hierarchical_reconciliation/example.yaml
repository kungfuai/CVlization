description: Hierarchical time series forecasting with coherence reconciliation using MinTrace, BottomUp and other methods on Australian Tourism data.
last_verification_note: "2025-11-07: Verified with CVL (6-month forecast, TourismSmall 89 series). Top-level results: Base AutoETS 20% error → BottomUp reconciliation 12.8% error (36% improvement, beats 15-25% benchmark). BottomUp outperforms MinTrace (as expected when bottom forecasts are strong). Coherence maintained across 4-level hierarchy."
