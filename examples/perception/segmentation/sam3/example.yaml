  last_verification_note: "Verified build, image inference (transformers), and video inference (native repo) on Blackwell RTX PRO 6000 (96GB). Video mode: 75-frame 360p clip tracked 26 objects, overlay MP4 + binary mask PNGs generated. Peak VRAM ~15GB for video. Vendored sam3 source, added ffmpeg. Requires HF authentication for gated model."
