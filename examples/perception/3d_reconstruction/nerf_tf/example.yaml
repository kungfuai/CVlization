  ⚠️ LEGACY EDUCATIONAL EXAMPLE - Neural Radiance Fields using TensorFlow 2.16.

  For production use, consider modern alternatives:
  - Instant-NGP (100-1000x faster, real-time rendering)
  - 3D Gaussian Splatting (real-time quality)
  - Nerfstudio (production-ready toolkit)

  This is "Tiny NeRF" - a minimal demo for learning NeRF concepts.
  The 3D/NeRF community has standardized on PyTorch for newer methods.
