description: |
  HunyuanWorld-Mirror is a feed-forward model for comprehensive 3D geometric
  prediction from images. It generates multiple 3D representations in a single pass.

  Outputs include:
  - Point clouds
  - Multi-view depth maps
  - Surface normals
  - 3D Gaussians
  - Camera parameters
  - Optional COLMAP reconstruction

  The model accepts optional geometric priors (camera poses, intrinsics, depth)
  and handles various 3D reconstruction tasks through a unified architecture.

    Verified build (PyTorch 2.9.0 runtime), inference with Desk example (2 images),
    model caching (~3GB HuggingFace), and core outputs on NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell (97.9GB VRAM).
    Outputs: 357,765-point cloud (5.2MB PLY), 2 depth maps (PNG+NPY), 2 normal maps (PNG).
    Requires PyTorch 2.9.0+ for Blackwell GPU compatibility.
    Note: Advanced features (3D Gaussians, rendered videos, COLMAP) disabled by default
    in runtime image due to missing CUDA toolkit. Enable with --save-gs, --save-rendered,
    --save-colmap flags (requires switching to devel base image).
