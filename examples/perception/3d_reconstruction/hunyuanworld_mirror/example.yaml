description: |
  HunyuanWorld-Mirror is a feed-forward model for comprehensive 3D geometric
  prediction from images. It generates multiple 3D representations in a single pass.

  Outputs include:
  - Point clouds
  - Multi-view depth maps
  - Surface normals
  - 3D Gaussians
  - Camera parameters
  - Optional COLMAP reconstruction

  The model accepts optional geometric priors (camera poses, intrinsics, depth)
  and handles various 3D reconstruction tasks through a unified architecture.
