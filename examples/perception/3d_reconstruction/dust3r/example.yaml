  DUSt3R (Dense Unconstrained Stereo 3D Reconstruction) performs 3D reconstruction
  from uncalibrated images using dense matching and global optimization.
  Outputs include 3D scenes (GLB), depth maps, and confidence maps.

  last_verification_note: "Verified build, inference (2 images), model caching (2.2GB), output file generation (GLB with 387k vertices, depth/confidence PNGs+NPYs) on RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell (96GB VRAM). Technical verification only - 3D geometry quality not inspected. RoPE CUDA compilation fails gracefully (PyTorch fallback works). Images mounted from hunyuanworld_mirror."
