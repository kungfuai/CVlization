description: Zero-shot OMR probing with Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct. Uses 4-bit quantization (~8GB VRAM). Answers 5 prompts about a piano score image (key signature, time signature, musical era, dynamics/tempo, full ekern transcription attempt). Useful as the B2a lower-bound baseline in the Bucket 3 model comparison matrix.

  last_verification_note: "Verified build (~12s) and inference (~10min) on NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell (98GB VRAM). Default sample: Biddle's Piano Waltz (1884, LoC). Results: time sig (3/4) correct; era (Romantic/1884) excellent — model read copyright text; dynamics/tempo good; key signature wrong (misread flats as sharp); full ekern transcription failed with header-loop hallucination. Output persists to host cwd. First run downloads ~18GB model (Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct)."
