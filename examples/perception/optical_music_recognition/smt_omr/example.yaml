verification:
  last_verified: "2026-02-21"
  last_verification_note: "Verified build (55s) and inference on NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell (98GB VRAM). Model PRAIG/smt-grandstaff loads correctly; produces valid two-column ekern notation (clef, key sig, time sig, notes, barlines) from a 672x256 GrandStaff system image. CER 0.28% / SER 0.65% / LER 0.83% vs ground truth. Output persists to host cwd. ~15MB VRAM idle after run (container exits cleanly). Note: antoniorv6/ checkpoints incompatible with current SMT codebase — use PRAIG/ models only."
