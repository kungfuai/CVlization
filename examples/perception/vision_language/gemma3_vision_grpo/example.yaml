  last_verification_note: "Training verified. Docker builds with PyTorch 2.9.0+CUDA 12.8 (optimized for vllm). Training completes successfully (60 steps, 1h 40m, 4.4GB VRAM) with GRPO rewards working. Post-training inference test has minor tokenizer bug (train.py:268) but model saves correctly. Requires build-essential for bitsandbytes compilation."
