  last_verification_note: "Verified build (8.18GB image), training initialization, dataset loading (York Lines, 27MB). Central caching implemented and verified - dataset downloads to ~/.cache/cvlization/data/york_lines/. Pretrained weights cached to ~/.cache/torch/ (ResNet50, DETR). Lazy downloading verified. Training metrics not fully verified due to GPU memory constraints (CUDA OOM on shared A10 GPU)."
