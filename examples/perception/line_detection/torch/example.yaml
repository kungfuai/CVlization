  last_verification_note: "Build successful (8.18GB image). Training initialization and dataset loading verified (York Lines, 27MB). Dataset downloads to ~/.cache/cvlization/data/york_lines/. Pretrained weights cached to ~/.cache/torch/ (ResNet50, DETR). Lazy downloading verified. Training metrics not fully verified due to GPU memory constraints (CUDA OOM on shared A10 GPU)."
