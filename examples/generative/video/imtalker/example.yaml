description: >
  IMTalker generates high-quality talking face videos using implicit motion
  transfer with flow matching. It achieves 40+ FPS on RTX 4090 with 512x512
  output resolution. Supports audio-driven and video-driven generation modes.
  Uses Wav2Vec2 for audio encoding and Flow Matching for motion generation.
