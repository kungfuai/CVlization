## Quick Start

```bash
bash examples/video_gen/skyreals/build.sh
bash examples/video_gen/skyreals/predict.sh
```

This will generate a video using a text prompt: "FPS-24, A cat wearing sunglasses and working as a lifeguard at a pool". You can also use an image prompt.

Edit the `predict.sh` to change the command line arguments as needed.
