description: Stable Video Diffusion with Cog (non-commercial license, 24GB VRAM)
notes: |
  This example uses Cog for containerization instead of Docker directly.

  Usage with CVL:
    cvl run svd-cog build
    cvl run svd-cog predict -i input_image=@demo.png

  Direct Cog usage:
    cog build
    cog predict -i input_image=@demo.png

  Cog manages Docker images internally via cog.yaml configuration.

  last_verification_note: "Fully fixed and verified. CVL Cog integration working correctly. Fixed numpy<2.0.0 constraint to resolve opencv-python ABI compatibility. Migrated from deprecated python_packages to python_requirements. Build succeeds (17.6GB image). Inference runs successfully through 96% (25/26 steps), downloading 19GB model (917 MB/s) and completing sampling. Fails at final decode step with CUDA OOM (needs 24GB, A10 has 23GB). All dependencies resolved - only VRAM limitation remains."
