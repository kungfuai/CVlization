  Real-time text-to-video generation with Krea 14B model.
  Supports text-to-video, video-to-video, and streaming inputs
  with 4-6 inference steps for fast generation.

  last_verification_note: "BLOCKED - SDK architecture incompatibility. The official Krea SDK (github.com/krea-ai/realtime-video) only supports 1.3B model architecture (1536 dim, 30 blocks) but krea-realtime-video-14b.safetensors checkpoint contains 14B model (5120 dim, 40 blocks). SDK has hardcoded model_name='Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B' in wan_wrapper.py with 14B option commented out. Example cannot run until SDK adds 14B architecture support. Docker build succeeds. Fixed checkpoint caching to use persistent /root/.cache/huggingface/checkpoints/ directory."
