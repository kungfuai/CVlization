A man with curly brown hair and a dark shirt with colorful patterns on the shoulder leans towards her from a green booth, holding a drink and smiling gently. He speaks to her, <S>I said I was sorry and I meant it. It just didn't fit in the five second version.<E> He continues, <S>Now Ovi gave me ten and I'm using all of them to be wrong again.<E> The woman looks up, her expression serious, and gestures with her left hand, a ring visible on her finger. She responds, <S>Impressive consistency.<E> The man leans back slightly, still holding his drink, and looks at her expectantly, <S>Would you mind telling me if the director can cut this take?<E> Audio: Upbeat background music, faint murmur of conversation, calm male voice, slightly dismissive female voice, clinking of glasses.",
