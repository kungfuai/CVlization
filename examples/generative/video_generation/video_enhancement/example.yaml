  Video artifact removal model that removes overlaid watermarks, logos, and text
  from videos. Trains on synthetic artifacts applied to Pexels Animals videos.
  Three pretrained models available on HuggingFace (zzsi/cvl_models): composite
  (default), nafunet, and nafunet_widescale.

  - video_enhancement
  - artifact_removal

limitations:
  - High-opacity text on bright/white backgrounds leaves visible ghost traces
  - Dense tiled watermarks covering the full frame are only partially removed
  - Models trained on synthetic artifacts only; real-world watermarks may differ
  - Trained at 256-384px; quality may degrade at higher resolutions
  - 30k training steps on ~500 Pexels videos; more data and steps would help

  last_verification_note: >
    Verified build, training (3 experiments x 30k steps on Pexels Animals),
    and inference on all 3 models. Tested on synthetic watermarks: diagonal text
    (3 layers, 0.9 opacity) and tiled patterns (2 layers, 0.9 opacity). Models
    reduce but do not fully remove dense high-opacity watermarks. Inference at
    ~33 fps on GPU for 512x288 input. Mark as experimental until removal quality
    improves.
