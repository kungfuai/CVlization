  last_verification_note: "Build successful (both ./build.sh and cvl run). Inference execution verified with both methods (./predict.sh and cvl run stable-diffusion predict). Output generation: 512x512 PNG, 415KB. Model caching to HuggingFace hub. All Python packages pinned in requirements.txt. Uses Stable Diffusion v1.5 model with FP16 precision, generates images in ~4-10s with 50 inference steps."
