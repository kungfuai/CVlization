  last_verification_note: "Verified build (both ./build.sh and cvl run), training initialization, dataset downloading (MNIST), and 1-epoch training completion. Fixed missing Dockerfile with pinned dependencies and CVlization library torchvision API compatibility. Data downloads to local ./data directory (not centralized cache)."
