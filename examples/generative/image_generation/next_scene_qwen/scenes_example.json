    "Wide establishing shot of a misty forest at dawn, camera slowly pushes forward",
    "Camera moves closer, revealing a narrow path winding through ancient trees",
    "The camera lowers and shifts to the right, focusing on morning dew on leaves",
    "Camera pans left as a deer steps into frame, soft light filtering through branches",
    "The camera follows as the deer walks deeper into the forest, atmosphere grows darker",
    "Camera tilts up to reveal the forest canopy, sunlight breaking through in rays",
    "Final wide shot pulling back to show the entire forest landscape bathed in golden light"
