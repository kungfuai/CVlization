  last_verification_note: "Build in progress (slow xformers download). Training cannot be verified - requires pre-computed latent files (data/latents/flying_mnist_11k__sd-vae-ft-mse_latents_32frames_train.npy) that are not included. README lacks data preparation instructions. Example incomplete without dataset setup on NVIDIA A10 (23028 MiB)."
