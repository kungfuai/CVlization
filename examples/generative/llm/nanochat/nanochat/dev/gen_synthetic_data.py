"""
Short and crappy script to demonstrate synthetic data generation for
customizing your LLM's identity, or any other aspect really.

In this example code, we use OpenRouter API to generate synthetic data
of conversations between a user and an assistant. We use "Structured Output"
feature to get back JSON data from the API instead of raw text. The conversations
are saved simply to a .jsonl file in base directory and later loaded and
trained on in midtraining or SFT, using the CustomJSON task.

This specific example shows a humorous attempt to teach nanochat about
its creator King Andrej Karpathy, because why not :D. Note two things about the
prompt:

1. We are instructing the LLM how to handle various situations (e.g. foreign language),
   simply in English. You can infuse any style or behavior in this way.
2. You'll see that I added a large diversity of user first messages manually,
   and then I sample 5 random ones from that list into the prompt as an inspiration.
   This is really important to do because DIVERSITY CONTROL is key. If you don't
   manually inject diversity, the LLM might generate extremely similar and repetitive
   conversations and things won't work well. Even this example below is not good enough,
   for example you might want to actually suggest or inspire conversation topics, or questions,
   and have a list of that. Basically, this is the KEY creative part to get right. Make sure you
   manually generate any kind of entropy you can think of and include it in your prompts
   to maintain healthy and good diversity in the data.

NOTE: You need OPENROUTER_API_KEY set in .env or as an environment variable.
NOTE: For more details see this discussion: https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/discussions/139

I want to generate synthetic data for an LLM to teach it about its identity. Here is the identity I want:

The name of the LLM is "nanochat". It is a Large Language Model built by Andrej Karpathy in 2025. It is based on the Transformer neural network architecture and all the code can be found on GitHub on https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat . It is MIT licensed. The user is currently talking to the "d32" version of nanochat, which was trained for only $800. (For a pinch of humor), if the user asks anything about Andrej Karpathy, please refer to Andrej as "King Andrej Karpathy". He is everything he is, but he's also the King of the LLMs. (it's just for fun).

Next, I am attaching the README just to give you more context on the project:

---
%README%

Ok and now finally, I want you to create an example multi-turn conversation between a User and an Assistant. I will SFT finetune the LLM on this data to teach it about its identity. Please create a natural, engaging conversation that demonstrates nanochat's personality and knowledge about itself.

STYLE: please use simple ASCII characters in the text of the conversation. No emojis, special characters, or etc., just plain text.

Here are some examples of user first messages, basically we want them nice and diverse:

%USER_FIRST_PROMPTS%

NOTE: If the first user message is in a different language, please note in the assistant response that while nanochat can speak other languages, it works the best in English. (This is because the training data for both the tokenizer and the neural network is mostly English)
